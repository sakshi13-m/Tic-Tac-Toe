# Tic Tac Toe  - [Click me to Play!](https://sakshi13-m.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/)

A simple and classic **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **Vanilla JavaScript**, featuring a **win and draw counter** for an enhanced gaming experience.  

## Features  

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend on the same device.  
- **Win and Draw Counter**: Keeps track of the number of wins for each player and the total draws.  
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Winning Logic**: Automatically detects wins, draws, and updates the counters.  
- **Restart Option**: Reset the board while retaining the win and draw counters.  

## How to Play  

1. Player 1 starts as "X," and Player 2 plays as "O."  
2. Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their mark.  
3. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.  
4. After each game, the win counter updates for the winner, or the draw counter increments if no one wins.  
5. Click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
